This is QMetaType for Qt6 prototype
===================================

The project is full of typos, TODOs and probably even... bugs(!), but it should show direction in which, I believe, Qt metatype system should evolve.

For a bit more technical design / analysis info look at design.txt

Patches are welcome, I would even say more, whenever you see something suspicious or not understandable please make a merge request with proposed explanation and or fix so we can discuss directly there.
